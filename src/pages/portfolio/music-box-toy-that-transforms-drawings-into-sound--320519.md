description: A Music making toy that takes marker drawings and turns them into
  sound so that even young kids aged 6-7 can learn the beginnings of music
  composition. Utilizes OpenCV Image Recognition on a Raspberry Pi Zero to
  enable limitless ways to draw composition.

    heading: Traditional music education focuses on physical performance, meaning
      only the dedicated few can participate.
    text: "Music education consists of performance & composition: Traditionally,
      educators focused only on the former, ability-based form of education.
      This excludes many people who enjoy music but are unable to keep up. On
      the other hand, composition is not dependent on physical ability, meaning
      much more people are able to enjoy music."

    heading: Design Goals
    text: Design should be both tactile and physical, allow directed and undirected
      play, have reusability and longevity, and have a reference to "vintage"
      toys (currently trending toy genre).

    text: "This project speaks to me personally, growing up I had learned to play
      classical music. However, in my later years I came to the upsetting
      realization that this knowledge was often useless in trying to apply it to
      modern music. I was fascinated with modern UX developments in music
      production, and also post-colonial critiques on western music theory. This
      project let me experiment with applying my own philosophy of design,
      alongside learning OpenCV, woodworking, and lasercutting. "
