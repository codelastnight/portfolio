    heading: Traditional music education on physical performance, meaning only a
      dedicated few can participate.
    text: "Music education consists of performance & composition: Traditional music
      education focuses only on the former, ability-based form of education.
      This excludes many people who enjoy music but are unable to keep up. On
      the other hand, composition is not dependent on physical ability, meaning
      much more people are able to enjoy music."

    heading: Design Goals
    text: Design should be both tactile and physical, allow directed and undirected
      play, have reusability and longevity, and have a reference to "vintage"
      toys (currently trending toy genre).
