    heading: Reflection
    text: Every design process continues to surprise me in the direction it goes. In
      this fast-paced project, I was pushed to cut corners and leave out parts I
      wished to elaborate on. I struggled on how to present a complex system in
      a limited visual space. I learned to design around existing parts, I
      started with a 2.1 inch round display, and created measurements based on a
      minor scale. While I'm often critical of technology, I enjoyed a "white
      mirror" approach to design here.
