    alt: "The Problem: 48hr Repack challenged us to redesign Hi-Coneâ€™s plastic
      6-pack ring carrier to be more eco-friendly. The goal was to allow both
      carrier and bottles to be recycled together, all while keeping high
      production speed and brand flexibility. Constraints: Must carry 6 bottles,
      Must be curbside recyclable to at least 60% of continental U.S., Avoid
      previous competition designs, 48hr time limit to design. Image on right:
      Existing 6 pack carrier solution"

    alt: "Material Exploration: Initally, we explored different and innovative
      materials: mushroom / agar-based packaging, rope / twine, hanging /
      clustering. In the end, we stuck with a simple paperboard design: low
      manufacturing cost, uses existing recycling infrastructure"
