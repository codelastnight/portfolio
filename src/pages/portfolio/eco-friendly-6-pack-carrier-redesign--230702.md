description: A paperboard only bottle carrier design. Easy to manufacture,
  environmentally conscious, and has a large marketing surface. Won 2nd place in
  the 2021 48hr Repack student competition.

    alt: "The Problem: 48hr Repack challenged us to redesign Hi-Cone’s plastic
      6-pack ring carrier to be more eco-friendly. The goal was to allow both
      carrier and bottles to be recycled together, all while keeping high
      production speed and brand flexibility. Constraints: Must carry 6 bottles,
      Must be curbside recyclable to at least 60% of continental U.S., Avoid
      previous competition designs, 48hr time limit to design. Image on right:
      Existing 6 pack carrier solution"

    alt: "Material Exploration: Initally, we explored different and innovative
      materials: mushroom / agar-based packaging, rope / twine, hanging /
      clustering. In the end, we stuck with a simple paperboard design: low
      manufacturing cost, uses existing recycling infrastructure"

    text:
      T﻿here was a challenge in designing a flexible paperboard package design
      in fusion 360. I learned how to use the sheet metal tool to create a
      parametric design that we could quickly iterate on.

    text:
      Single sheet of standard 6mm paperboard (comparable to cereal boxes). No
      glue required. Easily modified to fit other sizes, simple to manufacture.
      Large marketable surface area.

    heading: Reflection
    text: For further iterations, we would adjust and update the cutouts on the
      paperboard. For example, the fit of each bottle should be tested to make
      sure the design works best. Because it was my first year at Tech, I did
      not have access to the laser cutters. I would have loved to physically
      iterate. Additionally, matching timezones to work together proved a
      challenge.
